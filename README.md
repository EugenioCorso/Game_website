A mandatory project to pass the Distributed Programming I course of the Politecnico di Torino.

The request was to implement a distributed web applicazion using HTML and JavaScript for the user interface and PHP and MySQL for the backend.

I developed the application using HTML5, sticking with the MVC paradigm. For the style the CSS and Bootstrap framework have been used.

The s255185.sql file is the one who create the database and in the file	dp1_web_jul18.pdf there are the detailed specifications.
